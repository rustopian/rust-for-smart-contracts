# rust-for-smart-contracts

Exercises for heretolearn.xyz's Rust for Smart Contracts course

To begin:

```
git clone https://github.com/rustopian/rust-for-smart-contracts.git
cd rust-for-smart-contracts
```

Regularly run `git pull` to get the latest updates and exercises.

To begin with any individual exercise, `cd` into any exercise directory and run `cargo run` to compile and run the code. You might need to fix the code in order for it to compile. For example:

```
cd basics-01-variables-hot-potato
cargo run
```

For lessons 5 and on, also run `cargo test` to run the unit tests. You will need to write some code in order for the tests to pass! View the descriptions at heretolearn.xyz and the comments in the code to figure out what you need to do.

Regular lessons are not graded, but your completion is noted when you upload a screenshot of passing tests to heretolearn.xyz. The midterm and final exercises are graded.
